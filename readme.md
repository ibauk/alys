## ENTRANT STATUS
- **registered** (aka 'not signed in') - expected but not at Squires yet
- **withdrawn** (before signing in, aka 'DNS') - not expected at Squires
- **signed** in at Squires
- **checked out** - still out riding
- **finisher** - checked in at Squires within 24 hours
- **late finisher** - checked in at Squires after 24 hours
- **DNF** - ride is abandoned, not returning to Squires

## CHECK-OUT (START)
The check-out process involves capturing odo readings and changing a rider's status to 'riding'.

Riders are released initially in cohorts starting at 0500, then at 10 minute intervals until 0530 or some other predetermined time after which the timestamp changes each minute.

The odo capture screen initially shows 05:00 and trips automatically to 05:10 at 05:01, to 05:20 at 05:11 and so on.
